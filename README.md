## Usage:
This `Node.js` application can be used by any one who would like to save time and keep themselves well organized by creating a dev team roster with names IDs and contact information.

A command line prompt will guide the user thru a series of questions that will populate the roster with three different employee categories to choose between a Manager, Engineer and Intern.

Once all questions are answered and the user decides there are no more persons to add to the roster, an HTML file is generated and stored under the output folder that is also generated.

- Here it is an example of the questions prompted when the application is started with a list of the three categories:
